**🔧 Future Steps for Improvement**

🔄 Add Loading UI & Form Updates
• Implement a loading spinner on the booking button for better feedback during processing. Now it's not displaying when going from /accommodation/[id] passing through /booking.
• Ensure the form on this flow correctly updates with query values like checkIn, checkOut, and guests.
• Why: Enhances the user experience by providing feedback and ensuring accurate form data.

🛠️ Refactor Form Validation
• Extract form validation logic into a shared function or hook for consistency across forms (e.g., availability form, booking form).
• Why: Reduces code duplication and simplifies maintenance.

⚠️ Improve Error Handling
• Add better error handling for form submissions and API calls, showing clear, user-friendly error messages.
• Why: Provides better feedback, reducing user frustration and guiding them through corrections.

♿ Enhance Form Accessibility
• Ensure all form fields have proper labels and error messages are screen reader-friendly.
• Why: Improves inclusivity, ensuring the app is accessible to a wider audience.

📱 Improve Mobile Responsiveness
• Fine-tune the layout for mobile devices to ensure the booking flow is smooth and user-friendly on smaller screens.
• Why: Guarantees a seamless experience across all devices.

🚧 Rate Limiting & Bot Prevention
• Add rate limiting and bot prevention mechanisms to protect the system from abuse or malicious attacks.
• Why: Prevents misuse and ensures a smooth experience for legitimate users.

🎉 Toast Notification / Confirmation Modal
• The current booking success UI is modal-based, but consider decoupling it so it can be reused across other flows (e.g., booking confirmation, form submissions, errors).
• Why: Increases reusability and consistency across the app.

📅 Booking Calendar / Availability UI
• Implement a calendar UI (e.g., react-day-picker) for better date selection in the booking flow.
• Why: Provides a more user-friendly and intuitive experience for selecting check-in/check-out dates.
